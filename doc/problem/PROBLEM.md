## The Dining Philosophers Problem

### Description

It involves a group of philosophers sitting around a circular table with bowls of food and chopsticks placed between them. The philosophers alternate between thinking and eating, but to eat, they must use two adjacent chopsticks. The problem is to design a solution that avoids deadlocks, ensures fair access to chopsticks, and allows philosophers to eat without starving or conflicting over resources. It represents the complexities of concurrent programming and the need for proper synchronization mechanisms to manage shared resources effectively.

### Concurrency Issues
- Deadlock
- Starvation

### Best Synchronization Mechanism
- Mutex Lock
- Semaphore Lock
